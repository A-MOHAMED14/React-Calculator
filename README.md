# React Calculator

## Description

This is a simple calculator built using React and Vite, featuring a component-based structure for easy maintenance and scalability. It is designed to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The application allows users to input numbers and operators via an intuitive button interface. The project uses React's useState hook to manage input and result states, ensuring real-time updates with every button click. The eval() function is used (with basic error handling) to calculate the result of mathematical expressions.

The user interface includes a "Delete" (DEL) button for removing the last character and an "All Clear" (AC) button to reset the calculator. The application is responsive and works seamlessly across different screen sizes, making it accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.
